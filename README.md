# fizz-buzz
C++ Solution to Fizz Buzz without using the modulo operator

My solution to a lab assignment that I did in my Intro to Computer Science class with some minor edits. I only included the while loop version.

Exercise:

Write a C++ program solving Fizz Buzz, a classic interview problem. This program prints every number from 1 to the user input.
If the number is divisible by:
● 3, it prints Fizz
● 5, it prints Buzz
● 3 and 5, it prints Fizz Buzz

You must code this three times (one loop per program) using the following loops:
1. While loop
2. Do-while loop
3. For loop

Extra Credit:
[6 pts] For each part, have a solution that doesn’t use the modulo (%) operator.
[3 pts] For each part, have a solution that prints the result ONLY once. This means that you can’t
print a string in each divisibility case.
